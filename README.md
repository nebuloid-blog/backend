# Portfolio Backend
## Setup
1. Clone this repository by running `git clone git@github.com/nebuloid-blog/backend.git`.
1. In your terminal, `cd` into the project root.
1. Create a `.env` file and populate it with the requisite data!
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
1. Run `git submodule init` to register submodules.
1. Run `git submodule update` to clone submodules.
1. Open Docker Desktop and run `docker-compose up -d`.
1. Finally, you can run `yarn start` or `yarn dev`.
1. Now, you can use apps like *MongoDB Compass* and *Altair GraphQL Client*!

## Project Details
### Notable Technologies
- [GraphQL]
- [GraphQL Code Generator]
- [Express]
- [Mongoose]
- [Node]
- [TypeScript]

### Opinions
I started this project out using **Express** + **GraphQL**.
**GraphQL** is my preferred choice for APIs because of how fast it is!

This project does not use **Apollo GraphQL**, because it wasn't reasonable or me to build the backend with that large of a scope.
If needed, I can grab utilities from **Apollo** *Ã  la carte*.
See also, [*GraphQL the Simple Way*].

When creating an API, the frontend is only as powerful as the backend!
The backend opts to use GraphQL Codegen for type declarations.

#### Linters
For this project, I've opted to generate my own styleguide to follow.
I'd like to delve into the deep end of formatters and understand what they are capable of.
After all, I do have my own opinions about code style, as does everyone else of course.
To make this work, I've extended my own ESLint config, **Tabbify**.
